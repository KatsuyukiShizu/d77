\section{Compiling and running  d77}
\noindent
You can download Fortran90 source files, documents, and examples from 
GitHub:\cite{d77}\\
https://github.com/KatsuyukiShizu/d77\\
Shell scripts (d77.sh and run\_d77.sh), Fortran90 source files, and Makefile are in the src directory.
Go to your src directory and type:
\begin{verbatim}
make
\end{verbatim}
The executable file (d77.exe) is created in your src directory.\\

The default settings for 
the maximum number of electrons (Max\_ne),
the maximum number of atoms (Max\_n\_atm), 
the maximum number of vibrational modes (Max\_n\_mode),
the maximum number of CGFs (Max\_n\_cgf),
the maximum number of PGFs for each CGF (Max\_n\_pgf), 
and
the maximum number of electronic configurations (Max\_n\_elec\_config) 
are defined in a module, global\_constants.f90:
\begin{verbatim}
Max_ne = 100
Max_n_atm = 30
Max_n_mode = 100
Max_n_cgf = 1000
Max_n_pgf = 30
Max_n_state = 20
Max_n_elec_config = 1000
\end{verbatim}
Change the default settings depending on your computer's system environment.

Utility programs for d77 are in the src/util directory. 
A utility program, dpp, performs data preprocessing for d77.
dpp extracts data from Gaussian 16 output files (fchk and log files) and
saves them to INP\_ELEC and/or INP\_VIB directory. 
Shell scripts (dpp.sh and others) are in the src/util/dpp directory. 
Fortran90 source files and Makefile are in the src/util/dpp/f90 directory. 
Go to your src/util/dpp/f90 directory and type:
\begin{verbatim}
make
\end{verbatim}
The executable file (dpp.exe) is created in your src/util/dpp/f90 directory.\\

\clearpage
Edit your configuration file, for example, .bashrc:
\begin{verbatim} 
# AAAA is a directory where you created d77 directory.
alias d77='sh AAAA/d77/src/d77.sh'
export DIR_d77_EXE=AAAA/d77/src
alias dpp='sh AAAA/d77/src/util/dpp/dpp.sh'
export DIR_d77_dpp_f90=AAAA/d77/src/util/dpp/f90
\end{verbatim} 
To run d77, simply type:
\begin{verbatim} 
d77 'input file' 'results directory'
\end{verbatim}
If you have an input file, test.inp, and want to save the log file (test.log) and calculated data to res\_test directory, type:
\begin{verbatim} 
d77 test.inp res_test
\end{verbatim}
or 
\begin{verbatim} 
d77 test res_test
\end{verbatim}

$\tau_x = \rho_{\mathrm{S}_0\mathrm{S}_1}\times\left(-ex\right)$; 
$\tau_y = \rho_{\mathrm{S}_0\mathrm{S}_1}\times\left(-ey\right)$;
$\tau_z = \rho_{\mathrm{S}_0\mathrm{S}_1}\times\left(-ez\right)$. 
The spatial integral of $\tau_x$, $\tau_y$, and $\tau_z$ gives the $x$, $y$, and $z$ components of the S$_0$-S$_1$ 
transition dipole moment $\bm{\mu}$: ${\bm{\mu}} = \left(\int \tau_x d{\bf{r}}, \int \tau_y d{\bf{r}}, \int \tau_z d{\bf{r}}\right)$.
The positive and negative regions of $\tau_x$ and $\tau_y$ are cancelled out and therefore, the $x$ and $y$ components of $\bm{\mu}$ vanish ($\int \tau_x d{\bf{r}} = 0; \int \tau_y d{\bf{r}} = 0$). Meanwhile, the negative region of $\tau_z$ is more widely distributed than the positive region, leading to non-zero $\int \tau_z d\bf{r}$:  ${\bm{\mu}} = \left(0, 0, 3.31962\right)$ in debye.\\

\subsection{Vibronic coupling densities between S$_0$ and S$_1$ at optimized S$_0$ geometry}
This example shows how vibronic coupling densities are calculated with d77. 
Sample d77 input and output files are in the examples/C2H4/VCD directories. The first three steps are the same as in \bf{\ref{calc_VCC}}\rm{.}
\begin{enumerate}

\item{Run geometry optimization and frequency analysis with Gaussian 16. 6D and 10F options are required to run d77.}
\item{Generate freq.fchk and TD.fchk files.}
\item{Run dpp.}

\item{
Calculate vibronic coupling densities between S$_0$ and S$_1$.\\
A d77 input file is formatted as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
$comment

| 3 > : lowest excited singlet state (S1)

If you have an input file, VCD\_0\_3.inp, and want to save the log file (VCD\_0\_3.log) and calculated data to VCD\_0\_3 directory, type:
\begin{verbatim} 
d77 VCD_0_3 VCD_0_3
\end{verbatim}
d77 calculates the S$_0$-S$_1$ overlap density ($\rho_{\mathrm{S}_0\mathrm{S}_1}$), 
the derivatives of the nuclear electronic potentials for the seventh and ninth vibrational modes ($\nu_7$ and $\nu_9$),
and the vibronic coupling densities for the seventh and ninth vibrational modes ($\eta_7$ and $\eta_9$).
The calculated $\rho_{\mathrm{S}_0\mathrm{S}_1}$, $\nu_7$, $\nu_9$, $\eta_7$, and $\eta_9$
are written to RHO.cube, DVNE0007.cube, DVNE0009.cube, VCD0007.cube, and VCD0009.cube files 
in the VCD\_0\_3 directory.

Figure \ref{fig:vcd} shows the $\rho_{\mathrm{S}_0\mathrm{S}_1}$, $\nu_7$, $\nu_9$, $\eta_7$, and $\eta_9$ distributions visualized with Chemcraft. $\nu_7$ and $\nu_9$ dsitributions reflect the seventh and ninth vibrational modes, respectively. $\eta_7$ and $\eta_9$ are calculated from the relations: $\eta_7 = \rho_{\mathrm{S}_0\mathrm{S}_1} \times \nu_7$; $\eta_9 = \rho_{\mathrm{S}_0\mathrm{S}_1} \times \nu_9$. The spatial integral of $\eta_7$ and $\eta_9$ gives VCCs for the seventh and ninth vibrational modes, respectively.

The $\eta_7$ distribution suggests that the vibronic coupling for the seventh vibrational mode occurs around the carbon atoms. 
The $\eta_9$ distribution suggests that the vibronic coupling for the ninth vibrational mode occurs along the C$-$H bonds.
